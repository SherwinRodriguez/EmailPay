## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong, unique credentials
   - Rotate tokens regularly

2. **Gmail API**
   - Use OAuth 2.0 with minimal scopes
   - Store refresh tokens securely
   - Monitor API usage

3. **Wallet Security**
   - Verify OTP codes carefully
   - Use unique emails for wallets
   - Monitor transaction confirmations

4. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Enable CORS whitelist
   - Implement rate limiting

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize email content
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid eval() and similar functions

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Review dependency changes

3. **Authentication**
   - Use strong OTP generation
   - Implement token expiry
   - Validate email ownership

4. **Transaction Security**
   - Enforce policy limits
   - Implement idempotency
   - Validate wallet verification
   - Check transaction expiry

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Demo)

⚠️ **This is a demonstration project on Sepolia testnet.**

**Not Production-Ready:**
- JSON file database (no encryption)
- Mock PKP signing
- No rate limiting
- No request validation middleware
- No HTTPS enforcement
- No secrets management

### Production Requirements

Before deploying to production:

1. **Database Security**
   - Use encrypted database (PostgreSQL with encryption)
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Use prepared statements
   - Enable audit logging

2. **PKP Integration**
   - Integrate real Lit Protocol PKP
   - Implement proper key management
   - Use secure signing environment
   - Test PKP permissions thoroughly

3. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request validation
   - Use API keys/tokens
   - Enable CORS whitelist
   - Add DDoS protection

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS
   - Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
   - Enable security headers
   - Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Use VPC/private networks

5. **Monitoring**
   - Set up intrusion detection
   - Enable security logging
   - Monitor for anomalies
   - Set up alerts
